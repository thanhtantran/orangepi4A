# Custom Compiled from OrangePI Build Framework
These `.debs` can be installed as I have included multiple missing features. In the default kernel x3 important features (filesystem support) are missing

1. `cifs` support is added. In default kernel you cannot mount a samba shared directory!
2. `nfs` support is added
3. `binfmt_misc` filesystem support is still missing. So you cannot run `box86` applications. I will latter add it.

These kernerls can be used with official `jammy` image v1.0.4

## Update #1
Packages have been updated to resolve bluetoth connectivity issue with mouse / keyboards because of the absence of `UHID` module. Details here https://github.com/defencedog/orangepi4A/blob/main/Bluetooth%20Mouse%20Not%20Working%20Solved.md
